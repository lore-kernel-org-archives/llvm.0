With clang (and I assume it's similar with gcc), the
__builtin_ia32_readeflags_u{64|32} builtins specify that the EFLAGS
register is used (and the stack pointer is modified). Instructions
that may change EFLAGS are marked as defining EFLAGS, and clang and
gcc are careful not to move instructions that access EFLAGS past them.

One change you may see due to this patch is the compiler moving the
"pop %..." instruction away from the "pushf" instruction. This could
happen if the compiler determines that it could produce better code by
doing so---e.g. to reduce register pressure. The "gcc -O2" example
below shows this code movement.
