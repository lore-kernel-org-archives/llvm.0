No worries on the delay, the series is not exactly the smallest one I
have ever sent :) While the changes were mostly mechanical, I could have
definitely messed something up and I appreciate you taking the time to
review it and run it through some tests. Please let me know if I can be
of further assistance on that front.

If you have any thoughts on the blurb I had in the cover letter around
how to handle the warnings this series resolves with regards to
mainline, I would love to hear them.

Cheers,
Nathan
