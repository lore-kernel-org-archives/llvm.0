I am struggling to make my mind re how to think about this case.

"root" is very overloaded, but generally it does not mean "randomly
corrupting memory". Normally it gives access to system-wide changes
but with the same protection/consistency guarantees as for
unprivileged system calls.

There are, of course, things like /dev/{mem,kmem}. But at the same
time there is also lockdown LSM and more distros today enable it.

Btw, should this "prohibit writes to mounted device" be part of
LOCKDOWN_INTEGRITY? It looks like it gives capabilities similar to
/dev/{mem,kmem}.

Disabling in testing something that's enabled in production is
generally not very useful.
So one option is to do nothing about this for now.
If it's a true recognized issue that is in the process of fixing,
syzbot will just show that it's still present. One of the goals of
syzbot is to show the current state of things in an objective manner.
If some kernel developers are aware of an issue, it does not mean that
most distros/users are aware.

It makes sense to disable in testing things that are also recommended
to be disabled in production settings.
And LOCKDOWN_INTEGRITY may play such a role: we include this
restriction into LOCKDOWN_INTEGRITY and enable it on syzbot.
Though, unfortunately, we still don't enable it because it prohibits
access to debugfs, which is required for fuzzing. Need to ask lockdown
maintainers what they think about
LOCKDOWN_TEST_ONLY_DONT_ENABLE_IN_PROD_INTEGRITY which would whitelist
debugfs.
