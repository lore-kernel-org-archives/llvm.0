Most people were very enthusiastic about this change in the meetings... 
it wasn't even my own idea ^^

I don't think the fallibility is an issue. Lockdep is a debugging tool, 
and it doesn't have to handle all possible circumstances perfectly. If 
you are debugging normal lock issues you probably shouldn't be running 
out of RAM, and if you are debugging OOM situations the lock keys would 
normally have been created long before you reach an OOM situation, since 
they would be created the first time a relevant lock class is used. More 
objects of the same class don't cause any more allocations. And the code 
has a fallback for the OOM case, where it just uses the Location object 
as a static lock class. That's not ideal and degrades the quality of the 
lockdep results, but it shouldn't completely break anything.

The advantages of being able to throw lockdep checking into arbitrary 
types, like the Arc<T> thing, are pretty significant. It closes a major 
correctness checking issue we have with Rust and its automagic Drop 
implementations that are almost impossible to properly audit for 
potential locking issues. I think that alone makes this worth it, even 
if you don't use it for normal mutex creation...
