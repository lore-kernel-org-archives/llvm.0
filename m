It's that design pattern which is most of the problem, though. It's a 
left-over from the old pre-default-domain era (quite literally, in most 
cases, where drivers were just minimally bodged to simulate the previous 
core call of ops->detach_dev). In the modern 
always-attached-to-something paradigm, drivers should absolutely be able 
to figure out if an attach will fail *before* they throw away any 
existing device state.

If we reach the point of adding core code that only serves to help 
drivers emulate the new API using the old API because we'd rather 
undermine the new API design than fix the drivers, then frankly that 
seems like an argument for just reverting back to the old API.

Partial failure at the group level - i.e. one device's attach call 
failing after previous ones have succeeded and leaving the group as a 
whole in an inconsistent state - is a separate issue dating all the way 
back to day 1 of groups. I don't disagree with questioning the current 
implicit assumption that that just shouldn't ever happen, but it touches 
on different aspects of driver design than the above.

It could be implicit *because* it's contextual; the domain types already 
carry as much information as the flag would. Attaching to a non-core 
(unmanaged or SVA) domain type is the one case where core code has clear 
reason to unwind if an attach fails mid-group. The initial attach to a 
core domain from nothing in probe_device could be allowed to fail, but 
there there's clearly nothing to unwind, and leaving the device in limbo 
seems OK. Attaching from non-core to core should represent a repeat of 
something which previously succeeded for the given device+domain 
combination, so whether we permit that to fail-to-limbo or mandate that 
drivers must be able to repeat a previous success mostly depends on what 
we think is a reasonable expectation of how to design a driver (I think 
it comes down to whether anyone really needs any domain-specific 
allocations that have to belong to devices rather than the domain 
itself, and cannot otherwise be preserved over a detach/reattach cycle). 
Finally, core to core transitions via sysfs can probably be their own 
special case depending on what falls out of the others.

Ah, we're thinking of different notions of UAF - I just mean drivers 
dereferencing stale pointers in software. If software leaves the 
hardware pointing at the the wrong thing, then it's already not going to 
work as expected from then on, regardless of whether that 
descriptor/pagetable/whatever is subsequently freed or not, so as far as 
I'm concerned there isn't much meaningful functional difference between 
"broken" and "much more badly broken". Obviously it does matter more 
from an overall kernel safety/stability viewpoint, but that's only a 
concern for when we can't get the API-level functional correctness right 
in the first place.

Thanks,
Robin.
