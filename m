Not entirely sure what the motivation is from the compiler side but I
cannot immagine that they would be doing this if it was not more
efficient in some way.

I will test declaring __popcount{s,d}i2() as aliases of
__sw_hweight{32,64}() to see what effect that has but I figured that
calling the __arch_hweight variants was more correct because some
architectures (at least RISC-V and x86 when I looked) use alternatives
in that path to use hardware instructions and avoid the software path
altogether. While there would still be the overhead from the function
call, I figured not using the software fallback would at least soften
that blow.

Cheers,
Nathan
