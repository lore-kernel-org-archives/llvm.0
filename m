Well, if someone is stupid enough to plug in a parking lot USB stick
into their system, they get everything they deserve.  And a forced
panic isn't going to lead a more privilege escalation attack, so I
really don't see a problem if a file system which is marked "panic on
error", well, causes a panic.  It's a good way of (harmlessly)
punishing stupid user tricks.  :-)

The other way of thinking about it is that if your threat model
includes an attacker with physical access to the server with a USB
port, attacks include a cable which has a USB port on one side, and a
120V/240V AC mains plug on the the other.  This will very likely cause
a system shutdown, even if they don't have automount enabled.   :-)
