Thank you very much. There are several possible solutions to this issue, 
and the appropriate one depends on the specific scenario. For the 
problem in siw, the noinline_for_stack approach has been selected. In my 
opinion, this appears to be more of a workaround than a true fix. While 
it does mitigate the issue, the underlying problem in siw still remains.

That said, now that we have a clearer understanding of the problem and 
its root cause through discussions and extended analysis, a more robust 
and long-term solution should eventually be proposed.

Thanks,
