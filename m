So aside from the static_call usage, was there any other?

Anyway, I think I hate that __builtin, I'd *much* rather see a variable
attribute or qualifier for this, such that one can mark a function
pointer as not doing CFI.

I simply doesn't make sense to have a builtin that operates on an
expression. The whole thing is about indirect calls, IOW function
pointers.
