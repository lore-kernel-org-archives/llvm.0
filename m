Thanks! I will add it in the v2 patch.

xfrm_address_t is defined in include/uapi. So I am a little hesitant
to change it now.
Currently clang doesn't even have a check/warning to detect this.
I am not sure how clang will fix it in the future, in
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/78034.

The problem probably happens in all clang versions, depending on the
optimization flags and inline attributes
used. I found this problem when trying to add
-fdebug-info-for-profiling flag when compiling the code.
This patch is to fix kernel code where the problem happens, before
clang can give a better
solution in https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/78034.

I guess if people don't want the cost of zero initializing a union
variable, they will not use "=3D {}". And the situation that using "=3D
{}" only zero initializes the first member of a union variable isn't
very intuitive.

I feel it's unspecified in pre-c23 spec.
From https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/struct_initialization,
When initializing an object of struct or union type, the initializer
must be a non-empty,(until C23).

Great, I will use it in the v2 patch.

I totally agree with you. And if clang fixes the support, I guess it

Reported to clang upstream in
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/78034#issuecomment-2183233517.
It's a problem that still happens in the c23 standard.
