This one is _paravirt_ident_64, I believe. I think that the original
issue Nathan was seeing was with another seemingly innocuous function.

Kinda. It seems that the usage here is to let the compiler know that a
register may be modified by the callee, not just that it's an "actual"
return value. So it's suitable for void functions.

Good point. And there are some forms of these macros that specify
those as clobbers.

Possibly, though it may cause significant code degradation when the
compiler needs to store a value that's live over the ASM statement,
but the register it's in isn't actually modified. I saw that in the
example I gave in the description. In the case where a "movq" is used,
there's a useless move of "rdi" into "r11".

Doh! Someday I'll learn email.
