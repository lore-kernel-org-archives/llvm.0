Ah, I picked this up for media as well. Same for the other patch.
You should have gotten an email from patchwork on Oct 3 that it was accepted.

I think I should be more pro-active and reply when I pick up patches from
non-media developers instead of relying on patchwork. It seems that it is
easy to miss emails from patchwork.
