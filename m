Would you be ok if I was to make a tool to decompile a BPF program into its
source file equivalent?

So, a couple of things here. First, I really don't think we should
extend the panel API, like at all. But let's discuss that at Plumbers, I
don't think it's very relevant to this discussion anyway.

Second, you don't have to use this driver, like, at all. For anything
more complicated than what this driver can provide, I totally expect to
still merge dedicated panel drivers if it makes sense. I also expect
that this driver would be enough for 90% of our panel drivers and
would allow us to support most of the cruft.

Finally, the BPF API is flexible. You can extend it later on and old
programs would still work. The verifier would fail only if a program
uses a new function in a kernel that doesn't support it. I was kind of
expecting to put drm_display_mode in there at some point, if the state
makes sense then why not.
