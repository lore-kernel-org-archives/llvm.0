Eric S. is correct that for a filesystem image to enable panic on error, support
for panic on error should have to be properly consented to by the kernel
configuration, for example through an fs.allow_panic_on_error sysctl.

It can be argued that this not important, or not worth implementing when the
default will need to remain 1 for backwards compatibility.  Or even that
syzkaller should work around it in the mean time.  But it is incorrect to write
"This is fundamentally a syzbot bug."
