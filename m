Yeah indeed, totally understood. And I hope you enjoy your time off :)

This cycle has been crazy (2x baseline for 2025 and it seems that way
across many subsystems), and the LPC timing is unfortunate, so I can fully
understand why people have had less time for this series.

(I also have a personal interest in clang working for the kernel also as
all my builds are clang-by-default now and have been for a while!)

Sure, fully understood!

Stripping the stuff you have queued up from the series (+ sending deltas if
needed) will make it easier to send the rest post-merge window anyway.

No worries :)
