Okay, that is good information, thanks for providing it!

Right, I sent this version of the fix to spur discussion around whether
or not this was an acceptable approach, rather than having the question
sit unanswered in our issue tracker :) I have no problems sending a v2
to use div_u64() and be done with it, which I will do shortly.

Thanks for the quick input, cheers!
