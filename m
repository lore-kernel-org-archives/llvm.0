can: j1939: enable context analysis

This enables Clang context analysis for net/can/j1939/transport.o. It
annotates the TX timer state and the TX-send shutdown flag with
__guarded_by() and adds __acquires()/__releases() to the session-list lock
wrappers. It also adds a few comments around the TX timer pinning logic.

> Keep the analysis opt-in and its annotations separate from the J1939
> timer and send synchronization fixes.

[Severity: Medium]
Is this description accurate for the series?

The earlier fix in this series, "can: j1939: fix session reference leaks
on timer rearm" (Fixes: 9d71dd0c7009, Cc: stable), already added this to
j1939_session_new():

	spin_lock_init(&session->tx_send_lock);
	scoped_guard(spinlock_init, &session->txtimer_lock) {
		hrtimer_setup(&session->txtimer, j1939_tp_txtimer,
			      CLOCK_MONOTONIC, HRTIMER_MODE_REL_SOFT);
	}

At runtime the spinlock_init guard does nothing beyond spin_lock_init().
It only makes the analysis treat txtimer_lock as held while guarded
members are initialized. Here that is only needed because of the
__guarded_by(&txtimer_lock) on txtimer that this patch adds. By
comparison, tx_send_lock uses plain spin_lock_init().

The same fix also added the "Keep this alias across unlock" comment in
j1939_session_txtimer_cancel(). That comment seems to belong with the
context_unsafe_alias() added here.

The spinlock_init guard class comes from the recent commit d084a73714f8
("compiler-context-analysis: Introduce scoped init guards"). A stable
tree older than that has no class_spinlock_init. Would a backport of the
reference leak fix fail to build as written?

Could the scoped_guard(spinlock_init) move into this patch, next to the
__guarded_by() it supports? The stable fix would then use plain
spin_lock_init() and hrtimer_setup(). Otherwise, could the separation
claim be dropped from the commit message?

[Severity: Low]
Does the __guarded_by(&txtimer_lock) on txtimer match how this function
uses it?

The pointer is taken under txtimer_lock. Later in the same function, the
blocking cancel runs after the lock has been dropped:

	spin_unlock_bh(&session->txtimer_lock);

	if (ret < 0) {
		/* Keep the blocking cancel outside txtimer_lock. */
		ret = hrtimer_cancel(timer);

This has to run unlocked because j1939_tp_txtimer() takes txtimer_lock
itself. So the code deliberately uses the object without the lock that
the new annotation says guards it.

include/linux/compiler-context-analysis.h documents context_unsafe_alias()
as a context lock alias barrier:

 * @p: pointer aliasing a context lock or object containing context locks

struct hrtimer is not a context lock and does not contain one. Here the
helper seems to be used only so the analysis loses track of the alias.
That also stops checking the locked hrtimer_try_to_cancel(timer) call
right after it.

Would context_unsafe() around the unlocked hrtimer_cancel(), with a
stated reason, fit better? Another option is to leave the hrtimer
unannotated and guard only the bookkeeping bools.

The RX peer, j1939_session_rxtimer_cancel_sync(), uses the same pattern:
the alias is taken under the lock and hrtimer_cancel() is then called
unlocked. It has neither __guarded_by() nor an alias helper, so the two
timers end up documented differently.

Could the commit message also say that this unlocked access is exempted
from the analysis?
