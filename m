I can see the benefit of capturing some of the generational features in
a compatible, like the changes related to address width. But for pure
software features that doesn't have an actual bearing in the hardware,
I'd prefer if we relied on dynamic discovery.

But none of that applies to the question of "can I use compatible to
select if we should use the new or old Linux driver".

The userspace library is spaghetti, but when I wrote my own it turned
out quite succinct. The ioctl structs certainly could have been cleaner,
and documented, but it seems to me that a fair amount of the complexity
comes from the different use cases - such as SMMU vs XPU, secure and
unsecure buffers, remnants of now unsupported options.

I'm presuming that QDA will need to adopt most of these, and that QDA
support will be bolted into the spaghetti library.

I'm looking forward to learn more about this!

Yeah, this is unfortunate. It would certainly be nice to have a
documented and clean ABI.

Yeah, again, this isn't desirable.

If you believe this is the way to reach the proper design, then I won't
object. My requirement is that my userspace continues to work when my
distro suddenly switches FASTRPC=n/QDA=m.

I have no problems with dropping the fastrpc driver once the QDA is
drop-in-compatible. I'm also open to marking the compat layer deprecated
and eventually drop it once we're certain that users have moved to a
userspace that used the accel interface.

But we can't merge the QDA driver as long as we believe that
implementing a compat layer will be hard/impossible.
