Thanks!  This is a very interesting approach.

This case could be improved by distinguishing static local variables by
the function which references them (no DWARF needed).

BTW, we might want to consider upgrading "no correlation" to an error
unless the patch author explicitly adds some kind of annotation which
says a given missing correlation is expected.  Ideally they should be
rare unless a patch is removing or renaming symbols.

Hm, this issue is caused by -always-rename-promoted-locals=false.  We
should probably revert that flag, at least until if/when this series
gets merged.

Right, so full LTO collapses all the STT_FILE symbols into one.  Is
anybody actually using full LTO?  We could make klp-build reject it.

It may be simpler and cleaner to just have klp-build depend on
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO.  Assuming all or most livepatch users have that
enabled already?  Would need to support split/reduced as well.

Well for example, static locals defined in macros are very common (e.g.,
__msg, DO_ONCE, __print_once).  With this series and my "one line" patch
which adds a line to every .c file, I'm seeing thousands of "no
correlation" warnings with both GCC and Clang.  For example:

  drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon.o: warning: objtool: no correlation: r100_reloc_pitch_offset.__print_once
  drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon.o: warning: objtool: no correlation: r100_reloc_pitch_offset.__print_once.26
  ...

I don't think "deject ambiguity and reject" would work here.

The performance impact is concerning (but not a deal breaker I suppose).

The number of toolchain bugs is concerning (but not surprising).
