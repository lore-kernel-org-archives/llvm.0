Hi Nathan,

I think It should have been NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_USER, as the reload =
flag check is currently implemented in the user hint function. But If I =
see it correctly right now. We could remove the reload flag,
and NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_CORE should work as well. As the =
reg_query_database function is called unconditionally there.

I will prepare a patch that reverts the reload flag, and changes to =
NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_CORE as this already works. Or should it be =
NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_USER, as it=E2=80=99s results from an user
called function?

Cheers,
Finn=
