Wende was the one who made that comment in the commit message, not me,
so I won't be looking into this further, as I have little skin in this
game :)

In my humble opinion, allyesconfig is not indicative of any real world
scenario when it comes to kernel configuration or size, so when things
don't work with it, I tend to think more along the lines of "don't do
that then". A distributor is generally either going to distribute a
kernel for one device (in which case, they may build every driver that
they need for that platform into the kernel and turn every other driver
off, which won't result in a large kernel size) or for multiple devices
(in which case, they would want to want to build with modules as much as
possible, which also won't result in a large kernel size). Neither of
those scenarios is really represented by allyesconfig.

Furthermore, I am not sure that is really an LTO specific problem, it
sounds like a generic "kernel is larger than 1GB" problem to me, which
LTO could potentially show easier due to more inlining and such.

Cheers,
Nathan
