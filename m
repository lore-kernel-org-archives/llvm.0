I thought the point was to avoid "S" on compilers that would choke on
it?  If so, those compilers would surely choke on "Si" too, no?

I mean loosely things that resolve to something of the form
"symbol + constant" in the compiler output.

"S"(&((char *)key)[branch]) does indeed seem to do the right thing,
at least with GCC.

I probably didn't help by bikeshedding the way that expression was
written, apologies for that.  It's orthogonal to what this patch is
doing.

Is there a reason why we don't just build the whole kernel with
-fvisibility=hidden today?

Summarising all of this is it right that:

1) ld -pie is how we get the reloc info into the kernel for KASLR
today.

2) We use gcc -fno-pic today, but this might break with ld -pie in the
future, although it works for now.

3) gcc -fno-pic and gcc -fPIC (or -fPIE) generate almost the same code,
assuming we tweak symbol visibility and use a memory model that
ADR+ADD/LDR can span.  So, moving to -fPIE is likely to be do-able.


My point is that an alternative option would be to move to ld -no-pie.
We would need another way to get relocs into the kernel, such as an
intermediate step with ld --emit-relocs.  I have definitely seen this
done before somewhere, but it would be extra work and not necessarily
worth it, based on what you say about code gen.

This may all have been discussed to death already -- I didn't mean to
hijack this patch, so I'll stop digging here, but if I've misunderstood,
please shout!
