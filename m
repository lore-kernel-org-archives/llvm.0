Yes, I think that was the conversation that we had on the commit that
this fixes:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/YiD7R2wRxoWxtVq7@dev-arch.thelio-3990X/

I can test that on my Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 on Monday, although I would
like for this patch to be picked up in the meantime so that it is
possible to test UML on -next with clang. We can remove
-mno-global-merge in a follow up change, if you do not have any
objections?

Cheers,
Nathano
