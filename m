Same thing really; generally the point is that any of the more "special" 
default domain types set with the broad brush of Kconfig or command-line 
can cleanly fall back to the basic type wherever it turns out that 
there's a less-capable driver (or, eventually, IOMMU instance) present.

You mean "is automatic"? I'm missing how target_type and req_type are 
related here, but the general principle should be that if we have 
derived the type from iommu_def_domain_type, because we had nothing more 
specific from either a sysfs request or iommu_get_def_domain_type(), 
then a !IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA failure can retry with IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA. 
Otherwise any failure should be final.

Strictly that's not quite what the current code does, since 
iommu_alloc_default_domain() is losing the iommu_get_def_domain_type() 
vs. iommu_def_domain_type distinction, but in the former case a driver's 
.def_domain_type should definitely not be returning a type which that 
driver doesn't support, thus allocation failure would only really 
represent unexpected OOM conditions, where the retry would likely fail 
as well, and the whole system is probably dying anyway. If we're 
refactoring the whole lot, though, we may as well make it logically 
consistent.

Thanks,
Robin.
