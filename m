Hi Nathan,

thanks for this refactoring... looks good even though i would
have split it in more patches as this is doing quite many things.

But I will not be stubborn, I understand that it's not trivial to
have things split. I will give my r-b for now but I will check it
again before applying it as it's very easy to get tangled-up in
between all those defines:

For now I'm quite surprised to see how easily our CI gives green
lights :-P

i915 went multi-gt (multitile) so that some interfaces, like the
power management files, have effect only on one of the tiles.
This means that we needed to move some of the files inside the
newly created gt0/gt1 directory.

But, because some of those files are part of an ABI
specification, we can't simply transfer them from the original
position so that we needed to make a "hard" copy (actually the
original files now take the role of affecting all the GTs instead
of only one).

The complexity of this file comes from the necessity of
minimizing code duplication, otherwise we could have had two
perfectly identical files (which looking at the final result it
wouldn't have been a completely bad idea after all).

Thanks again, will let you know when I will get this into our
branch.
