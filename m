Just for context: Most of our (Asahi) developers' workflow involves
loading kernels over USB from another machine. That other machine can be
any OS, but if it's another M1/2 running macOS you get the additional
perk of USB-PD tooling to remote-force-reboot the target machine as well
as get a real physical serial port. The same tooling could be ported to
Linux-on-M1/2 relatively easily, but nobody has done that yet (probably
because these days we have a hypervisor that gives you a superset of
that functionality anyway, over standard USB, so it's not that necessary).

I personally use an x86 host and a hardware contraption to provide the
same hard reboot/UART functionality (for the rare case when the
hypervisor borks, to avoid having to hold down power buttons).

So there are certainly some people who'd benefit from using a macOS
machine as a build host, either for the special USB-PD functionality or
because they just like macOS as a development environment. It sounds
like getting it to work isn't that hard, so perhaps it's worth upstreaming?
