Agreed.

To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure about the potential impact of making
'--itrace=i1i' the default for 'perf annotate --data-type' across all
architectures, so I took the most conservative approach and restricted it
to ARM SPE.

However, if another architecture's auxtrace backend also synthesizes multiple
events from a single instruction, it would in principle need --itrace=i1i as
well. I also tested this on an Intel environment for comparison, enabling
--itrace=i1i or not yielded the exact same sample count, so making it the
default should be safe:

  perf annotate --data-type --stdio --type-stat
     total 880, ok 711 (80.8%), bad 169 (19.2%)

  perf annotate --data-type --stdio --type-stat --itrace=i1i
     total 880, ok 711 (80.8%), bad 169 (19.2%)

So I agree with your point, I'll move this configuration directly into
itrace_synth_opts__set_default().

Yes, default_single_event_per_ip is indeed much more accurate and clear.
I'll fix it.
