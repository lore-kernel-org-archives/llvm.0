Yes, that's right. The CPUs we have *do* tend to support BE, but
practically there isn't any software to run on them. I asked about
removing it a few years ago:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20191011102747.lpbaur2e4nqyf7sw@willie-the-truck/

but Hanjun said that Huawei are using it, so it stayed.
