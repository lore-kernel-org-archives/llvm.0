I have exactly zero idea what your point is here. You were saying that
it's bad because panels get to probe later now and you wouldn't see an
error. I'm saying it's already what happens today with a significant
part of the install base and doesn't seem to bother you.

I'm not talking about BPF programs themselves, I'm talking about your
double standard.

I've been writing panel drivers longer than you did, there's no need to

How? You keep saying those broad, alarmist statements. Look at the BPF
examples I provided. *How* is it "making the problem worse by a large
factor" exactly?

Just like I said to Rob, I don't mind changing that driver to accomodate
your fear or anxiety. But "this is shit" isn't a review, it's abusive
behaviour. If you plan on continuing that trend, don't.

Hahahaha, yeah, sure. I don't care about upstreaming anymore and just
want to scorch-earth the entire kernel to have an excuse to retire and
do goat farming. You got me.

However, given the current state of this discussion and the intention
you're giving me, it does sound appealing.
