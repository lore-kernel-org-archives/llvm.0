It seemed redundant to have it separate when it would always be needed.
In v5 I had the const in the BOS (now POS) macro, but realized that this
was silly since it would always need to be that way for __pos.

Yup, that's expected, and I wanted to tie it strictly to the expansion
of __pass_object_size since otherwise GCC would gain the "const" bit
(which technically shouldn't matter, but this whole series has been
nothing but corner case after corner case, and I didn't want to risk
another one).

AFAIU, this shouldn't be a problem for any of these. Nothing is trying
to take memcpy, memset, etc by address. The macro-ified version of this
change proved that out. :)
