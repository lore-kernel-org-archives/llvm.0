The attribute is about how the *current* function is instrumented, not
about anything called by this function.  This is clearly documented:
'no_sanitize_address'
'no_address_safety_analysis'
     The 'no_sanitize_address' attribute on functions is used to inform
     the compiler that it should not instrument memory accesses in the
     function when compiling with the '-fsanitize=address' option.  The
     'no_address_safety_analysis' is a deprecated alias of the
     'no_sanitize_address' attribute, new code should use
     'no_sanitize_address'.

I am stating facts, I am not trying to solve your problem there.  It
seemed to me (and still does) that you didn't grasp all facts here.

That is up to the memcpy implementation itself, of course.

And still you want us to do something that is impossible under those
existing constraints :-(

If you want the external memcpy called by modules A, B, C to not be
instrumented, you have to link A, B, and C against an uninstrumented
memcpy.  This is something the kernel will have to do, the compiler has
no say in how the kernel is linked together.
