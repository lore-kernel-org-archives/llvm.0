It's kind of what we already do. It somewhat works, but doesn't address

Great, more judgmental stuff. It's a v1 that hasn't been merged yet.
What problems did it create exactly, and for who?

The only one who claimed it was a generic solution was you. I've been
pretty clear from the very beginning that I wasn't expecting it to be a
one-size-fits-all solution.

So if you want to review your idea of what this driver is, fine, but
keep me out of the recipient list.
