no_sanitize_address or lack thereof is whether the current function
shouldn't be or should be ASan instrumented, not on whether other functions
it calls are instrumented or not.  memcpy/memmove/memset are just a tiny bit
special case because the compiler can add them on their own even if they
aren't present in the source (there are a few others the compiler can
pattern match too) and various builtins can be on the other side expanded
inline instead of called, so one then gets the sanitization status of the
function in which it is used rather than whether the out of line
implementation of the function is sanitized.

If coexistence of instrumented and non-instrumented memcpy etc. was the goal
(it clearly wasn't), then the sanitizer libraries wouldn't be overriding
memcpy calls, but instead the compiler would redirect calls to memcpy in
instrumented functions to say __asan_memcpy which then would be
instrumented.

It is, for all functions, whether compiled with -fsanitize=address or not,
if user app is linked with -fsanitize=address, libasan is linked in and
overrides the libc memcpy with its instrumented version.

Note that the default shadow memory value is 0 which means accessible,
so even when memcpy is instrumented, when called from non-instrumented code
often it will not do anything beyond normal behavior, as non-instrumented
functions don't poison the paddings in between variable (there even doesn't
have to be any) etc.  But e.g. malloc/operator new etc. is also overridden,
so buffer overflows/underflows on memory allocated that way from
uninstrumented code using memcpy etc. will be diagnosed.
