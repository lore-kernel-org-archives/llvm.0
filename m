So in the GCC bugzilla you raise the point of unwinding.

So in arch/x86 we've beeing doing what this attribute proposes (except
without that weird r11 exception) for a long while.

We simply do: asm("call foo_thunk"); instead of a C call, and then
have the 'thunk' thing PUSH/POP all the registers around a regular C
function.

Paravirt does quite a lot of that as well.

In a very few cases we implement a function specifically to avoid all
the PUSH/POP nonsense because it's so small the stack overhead kills it.

For unwinding this means that the 'thunk' becomes invisible when IP is
not inside it. But since the thunk is purely 'uninteresting' PUSH/POP
around a real C call, this is not an issue.

[[ tail calls leaving their sibling invisible is a far more annoying
   issue ]]

If the function is one of those special things, then it will be a leaf
function and we get to see it throught he IP.


Now, the problem with __preserve_most is that it makes it really easy to
deviate from this pattern, you can trivially write a function that is
not a trivial wrapper and then does not show up on unwind. This might
indeed be a problem.

Ofc. the kernel doesn't longjmp much, and we also don't throw many
exxceptions, but the live-patch people might care (although ORC unwinder
should be able to deal with all this perfectly fine).

In userspace, would not .eh_frame still be able to unwind this?
