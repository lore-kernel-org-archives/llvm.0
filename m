 You need to remove the argument from the !CONFIG_CPU_HAS_DIEI versions of 
the macros then too or otherwise we now have an inconsistent API between 
kernel configurations.

 AFAICT the only call site is in arch/mips/kernel/entry.S (and for
`local_irq_enable' only), and it doesn't supply the argument, which is why 
you could have removed it for CONFIG_CPU_HAS_DIEI at all.

 FWIW I find your reported warning questionable, there are valid reasons, 
such as the very situation here, why an argument might not be used.  It is 
only a macro after all, effectively a source code transformation tool.  
Similarly the C preprocessor does not warn about unused macro arguments.

 So IMHO your change has crippled reasonable code just to paper over a 
tool's deficiency.
