I don't see any reason for you to define a "hw specific compatible",
because as you have shown in this series (and as Rob point out), there's
no difference in the "hardware".

The only reason for your "hw specific compatible" is to make a software
selection in Linux - and that's not what DeviceTree is for.


As such, I don't see that you have a DeviceTree problem at all, because
this is a Linux-internal problem.

This is the actual problem!

We have existing user space that depends on the ioctl interface exposed
by the current misc driver. You must not break these.

Hardware cutoff is not a viable solution, because that's just a
declaration that we'll let the old platforms rotten - or alternatively
you commit to maintain two drivers to the very same feature and quality
level.

So the only reasonable solution is #2; from there it's a valid question
if you reach that point my stepwise migrating the current misc driver
that solution, or if you present a new driver with the fully backwards
compatible interface, alongside the new ABI.


But this does bring to a question which the cover letter should explain
- but doesn't: what problem does this patch series actually solve?
