Sort of. I am not super knowledgeable on the internals of LLVM's
integrated assembler but as far as I understand it, the use of the
'.option' directive creates a new fragment within this subsection, which
messes up the integrated assembler's ability to resolve the differences
between these labels outside of the subsection. Moving the directives
into the subsection allows it to do this. So your patch did not really
do anything wrong, it just exposed existing brittleness (hence why I
did not add a Fixes tag).

Thank you a lot for the quick testing and review!
