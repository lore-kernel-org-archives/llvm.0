[TLDR: I'm adding this report to the list of tracked Linux kernel
regressions; all text you find below is based on a few templates
paragraphs you might have encountered already already in similar form.
See link in footer if these mails annoy you.]

Thanks for the report. To be sure the issue doesn't fall through the
cracks unnoticed, I'm adding it to regzbot, the Linux kernel regression
tracking bot:

#regzbot ^introduced 99cb0d917ffa1ab628bb67364ca9b162c07699b1
#regzbot title arch: link failures in CI with Debian's binutils
#regzbot ignore-activity

This isn't a regression? This issue or a fix for it are already
discussed somewhere else? It was fixed already? You want to clarify when
the regression started to happen? Or point out I got the title or
something else totally wrong? Then just reply and tell me -- ideally
while also telling regzbot about it, as explained by the page listed in
the footer of this mail.

Reminder for developers: When fixing the issue, add 'Link:' tags
pointing to the report (see page linked in footer for details).

Ciao, Thorsten
