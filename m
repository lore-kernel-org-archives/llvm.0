That's a very good question, and I haven't really thought about it tbh.
I don't think it would be super hard to implement though. For panels
itself, we don't typically track anything in the state. panel_bridge
however would still need to fill its own bridge state but that only
contains the bus formats and flags which can be infered from the DT.

Another thing we might need for the connector is whether it's active or
not, but panel ICs typically don't tell you that anyway, and you can
always infer it from the encoder / previous bridge state.

And then, for the first kernel modeset, we end up in the same situation
than a regular driver I suppose.

I'm not really concerned about that part, because:

* You can *already* support a panel with a proprietary out-of-tree
  module, and it hasn't really affected us so far

* In fact, it's easier to decompile an hypothetical proprietary BPF
  program than an compiled .ko file (that we wouldn't be able to load
  anyway), so if we really end up there, it would be easy for us to get
  to the source code again.

* And panels are so trivial that I don't really see the importance of
  having support for them in the kernel anyway. It's constant tedious
  work that is barely documented, fragile, and provides very little
  value. And the vast majority of the panels are not supported anyway
  except for some willing OEMs (that are using panel-edp anyway) and
  willing hobbyists/consultants. So we probably wouldn't miss much.
