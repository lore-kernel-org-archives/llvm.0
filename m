When building with CONFIG_LTO after commit ba00c2a04fa5 ("arm64: fix the
build with binutils 2.27"), the following build error occurs:

          ^

Similar to the issue resolved by commit 0072dc1b53c3 ("arm64: avoid
BUILD_BUG_ON() in alternative-macros"), there is a circular include
dependency through <linux/bits.h> when CONFIG_LTO is enabled due to
<asm/rwonce.h> appearing in the include chain before the contents of
<asm/alternative-macros.h>, which results in ALTERNATIVE() not getting
expanded properly because it has not been defined yet.

Avoid this issue by including <vdso/bits.h>, which includes the
definition of the BIT() macro, instead of <linux/bits.h>, as BIT() is the
only macro from bits.h that is relevant to this header.
