I can at least explain the stats. When perf starts it has to
"synthesize" the state-of-the machine, it generates fake events to
describe the mmaps in each process by reading /proc. This is done most
typically so a virtual address can be turned into a filename and line
number. Generally this is done for the text part of a binary but it
may also be done for the data. Large systems may take a long time to
synthesize all the state for, hence the benchmark.

The result I normally look at above is the "Average time per event",
so without LTO or with thin LTO each event is taking approx. 180
microseconds to create. With full LTO the time taken per event is 110
microseconds, which could be a noticeable start-up time win.
