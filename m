Yes, it's considered valid with the name of the journaled group quota
file being "Jnoinit_itable(errors=remount-ro".  Which is very odd, but
in theory, if that file existed, quotaon would have tried to find that
file and used it as the group quota.

(Old-style quota files, which we still support because (a) there might
be RHEL users using system setups that haven't been updated since the
RHEL3/RHEL4 days and (b) there are still stackoverflow answers and
other FAQ posts on the web telling people how to enable quota using
these ancient schemes, are passed into kernel, but aren't actually
used by the kernel; instead the userspace quota tools parse either
/etc/mtab or /proc/mounts to find the relevant mount option and then
try to use the named file as the user or group quota file.)

Thanks for fixing this so promptly!
