The aarch64 one could be inherited from
arch/arm/include/asm/jump_label.h (2012), which could in turn be
inherited from x86 (2010).
Both the constraint "i" and the modifier "c" are generic..
For -fno-pic this combination can be used for every arch.

I agree that using "S" and "i" would introduce complexity.
Using just "S" as this patch does should be clear.

All of "i" "s" "S" support a symbol or label reference and a constant offset (can be zero),
(in object file, a symbol and an addend; in GCC's term, the sum of a SYMBOL_REF and a CONST_INT).

The asm is position-independent.
This `.long sym - .` is a common metadata section pattern to support PIC:)

Regarding the constraints, I've updated
https://maskray.me/blog/2024-01-30-raw-symbol-names-in-inline-assembly

I remember that Ard has an RFC
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/20220427171241.2426592-1-ardb@kernel.org/
"[RFC PATCH 0/2] arm64: use PIE code generation for KASLR kernel"
and see some recent PIE codegen patches.

I agree that current -fno-PIE with -shared -Bsymbolic linking is a hack
that works as a conincidence, not guaranteed by the toolchain.
This jump_label improvement (with no object file difference) fixes an
obstacle.
