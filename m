Sure, that sounds totally reasonable to me.

Yeah, I have been spread quite thin between trying to keep the current
ClangBuiltLinux continuous integration setup green, developing a new one
due to changing constraints elsewhere, updating my own personal testing
framework to be quicker for more efficient local testing (especially for
stuff like this), and my Kbuild maintainer duties, in addition to some
personal time off for my wife's birthday before Plumbers.

All that to say, I am not sure how much else I will want to take for 7.4
at this point, as I would like to have the kbuild tree basically
finalized by 7.3-rc7, which is the weekend right after Plumbers if my
calendar is correct. I would like to study these patches to make sure I
understand everything well and I don't think I will have the time to do
that until after the 7.4 merge window opens.

> Thanks for all your help with this! Is much appreciated.

Absolutely, thanks for engaging and trying to make Kbuild better :)
