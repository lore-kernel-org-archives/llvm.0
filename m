Thanks Nick,

I had already applied the squashed commit composed of  "ANDROID: x86:
entry: work around LLVM_IAS=1 bug in LSL" (the one using .quad) and
"ANDROID: x86: entry: fix LSL open coding", so I have already:

.macro LOAD_CPU_AND_NODE_SEG_LIMIT reg:req
movq $__CPUNODE_SEG, \reg
+#ifdef __clang__
+.long 0xc0030f48
+#else
lsl \reg, \reg
+#endif
.endm


So in principle my kernel image should boot when built with LLVM_IAS=1
but to my surprise all my systems (Sony VAIO i7, Intel NUC DN2820FYKH
with Celeron D2830, Athlon 200GE) are affected by hard reboot when
executing the kernel image

I'm trying to understand how to build (and boot) with LLVM_IAS=1 and
using clang 11.0.2 shipped with AOSP Android 11
