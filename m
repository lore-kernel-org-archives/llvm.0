TBH, that's exactly how Maxime presented the idea to me before
submitting this.

Ouch. This immediately raises the "let's implement a parser in the
kernel" flag, or "let's create a new langage".

That's exactly what BPF is: ou have a source file (in C, rust, whatever)
that is converted to a binary blob that the kernel already knows how to
use and that is safe to load, and we can easily go back to the sources.

See Maxime's answers: yes, falling back to dedicated driver is still
encouraged.

You'd still need a dedicated driver for your new blob parser, with far
fewer people who had had a look at it than BPF who has been working on
for several years.

The integration of BPF and the kernel is honestly transparent nowaday:
calling a struct_ops BPF function is just a function call away, and from
the bpf calling anything in the kernel is also just a call away.

Isn't that what Maxime wants to have? One driver for a plethora of DSI
panels, with the same ability the BIOS has to also do function calls to
set things up?

Cheers,
