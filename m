That's good.  Yes, I'll squash it into the base patch, but the Link: to
this fix will appear in the permanent record, for the inquisitive.

This seems appropriate.  Changing the type of incoming arg `size' feels
a bit fake - this is the per-bdev buffer_head size and expressing that
as a sector_t is misleading and unrealistic.
