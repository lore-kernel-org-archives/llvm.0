The reason why a sysctl isn't really great is because the system
administrator might want to configure the behavior on a per-file
system basis.  And you *can* configure it as a mount option, via
"mount -o errors=continue" or "mount -o "errors=panic".  The
superblock setting is just the default if something isn't explicitly
specified as a mount option (either on the command line or in
/etc/fstab).

So mount does not "automatically" panic the kernel, and there are
*plenty* of ways to opt-out.  You can use the mount option; you can
run "tune2fs -e continue"; you can just !@#!?! run fsck.ext4 before
mounting the file system.  There are all ways of "opting out."  Some
of them, such as the last, is even considered best practice --- just
as picking up a USB stick, or worse, a firewire drive, in a parking
lot, and *not* plugging it into your laptop is considered best practice.
