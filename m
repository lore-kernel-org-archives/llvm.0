There are a LOT of words in this cover letter.  The whole thing is a bit
overwhelming to try to review, much less answer these questions.  Please
don't use LLM-generated text, as it can be very difficult to follow.

Also, I noticed the cover letter has several back-references to v1,
adding to my confusion.  The cover letter should be self-contained, such
that a reviewer can easily understand what the patch series does without
first studying v1.

DWARF is the most controversial and complex part of this series.  Before
going there, we should look at whatever can be improved *without*
relying on DWARF.  That will then make it much easier to evaluate what
additional benefits can be provided by DWARF later on.

klp-build is very much a pragmatic tool, and most likely will never be
able to handle all possible AI-imagined edge cases.  It should always be
used with caution, with someone (or something) double checking its
results at the end.

I suggest splitting up the patch series, focusing on fixing the more
realistic and tractable issues first.  Maybe even one issue at a time.
Human reviewer attention is spread very thin right now, please make
legibility a top priority.
