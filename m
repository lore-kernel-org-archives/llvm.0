I was not aware. I did the test with a dummy memset implementation:

| void foo(char *s, unsigned int count)
| {
|     while (count--)
|         *s++ = 0;
| }

Before this patch (i.e. with builtins), GCC does this:

| foo:
|     testl    %esi, %esi    # count
|     je    .L7    #,
|     pushq    %rbp    #
|     movl    %esi, %edx    # count, count
|     xorl    %esi, %esi    #
|     movq    %rsp, %rbp    #,
|     call    memset    #
|     popq    %rbp    #
|     ret
| .L7:
|     ret

Here, we can clearly see that the function is optimized to a call
to memset.

After this patch (i.e. without builtins), the call disappears:

| foo:
|     testl    %esi, %esi    # count
|     je    .L1    #,
|     movl    %esi, %esi    # count, count
|     leaq    (%rdi,%rsi), %rax    #, _12
| .L3:
|     addq    $1, %rdi    #, s
|     movb    $0, -1(%rdi)    #, MEM[(char *)s_8 + -1B]
|     cmpq    %rax, %rdi    # _12, s
|     jne    .L3    #,
| .L1:
|     ret

So yes, the -fno-builtin will remove the optimizations at least
for GCC (not tested for clang).

What is funny is that the thread you are pointing at mostly
complains about the compiler doing optimization in the user's
back.

There will be some cases in which the compiler will find valid
optimizations and some cases it will do some silly
one (e.g. transform a very small loop to a function call). The
problem is to know whether the clever optimizations outweigh the silly
ones or not. I wonder if any benchmark exists on that.

If compiler optimizations are indeed worth it, we should then have
a look at the other architecture which uses the -fno-builtin flag
(or the -ffreestanding).

Regarding this patch, I do not think it should be applied anymore
unless proven that "optimizations" are detrimental and thus
unwanted.

Instead, I am thinking of just using -fno-builtin-ffs to remove
the annoying -Wshadow warning. Would that make more sense?

Thank you.


Yours sincerely,
Vincent Mailhol
