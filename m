Yes, I see 2 solutions:

- either use PUD mappings, which is not that easy because we'd need the 
physical and virtual addresses to both be aligned on 1GB, which is very 
unlikely (the kernel is generally loaded at 0x8020_0000). We could use a 
relocatable kernel to offset the virtual kernel address though.

- or use a second early_pmd, which would make sense as we reserve 2GB 
for the kernel mapping anyway, but I'm not sure it would work without a 
bunch of modifications.

Let me know if that would help and I'll give it a try (unless you want 
to take care of that of course!).
