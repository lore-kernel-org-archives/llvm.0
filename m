Arnaldo, can the tools/include headers be made hermetic?

You may have better luck with the development tree:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/acme/linux.git/
branch perf/core. The perf tool is backward compatible with old
kernels, unfortunately Debian packages it wrong which causes issues
everywhere.

Thanks,
Ian
