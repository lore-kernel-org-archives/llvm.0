That's exactly where BPF shines. The simple rule of thumb is: there is
no API stability guaranteed. Basically, thanks to the verifier and CORE
(Compile Once Run Everywhere), you don't need to keep the API stable and
available forever. There are multiple ways of dealing with it, but the
gist is that if a BPF is trying to load an "old" API, it will be
rejected by the verifier.

Then it's a matter of being nice enough in the kernel and provide ways
to deal with those.

To give you a few examples:

- in HID-BPF, in userspace, we keep old versions of APIs in separate
	compiled objects. Each is incremented (by 10 so we have a little bit
	of room in the middle). Then the loader tries first
	0020-device-with-new-api.bpf.o, and if it fails, it tries
	0010-device-with-old-api.bpf.o

	I'm not saying we should do the same here, but that's one idea

- recently, a BPF commit broke the ABI of a function while removing
	implicits: bpf_wq_set_callback_impl() was replaced by
	bpf_wq_set_callback() with a different number of arguments. I simply
	had to add a new function in my header which basically does:

	static inline int
	hid_bpf_wq_set_callback(struct bpf_wq *wq,
	                        int (*callback_fn)(void *, int *, void *),
	                        unsigned int flags)
	{
      if (bpf_ksym_exists(bpf_wq_set_callback))
              return bpf_wq_set_callback(wq, callback_fn, flags);
      if (bpf_ksym_exists(bpf_wq_set_callback_impl))
              return bpf_wq_set_callback_impl(wq, callback_fn, flags, NULL);
  }

  And then I changed the bpf.c to use hid_bpf_wq_set_callback() and the
  bpf is compatible with both APIs

- with CORE, struct fields are relocated on the fly when you load the BPF
 
  So for instance, if my BPF only accesses fields .name, .phys and .id
  in the BPF, I can define:
  struct hid_device {
    char                       name[128];
    char                       phys[64];
    unsigned int               id;
  }

  Then when loading the bpf, the verifier replaces all offset to the
  ones actually used by the running kernel, and the program loads
  transparently, even if you add fields before/after or change the
  fields order in the kernel.

Changing the mindset is the hardest part of it. But once you are making
the shift, it's actually much better to work with. It doesn't mean you
can go yolo. You still need to be careful in your choices knowing the
impact on your users. But the API at version 0 is not frozen and you
don't need to maintain it forever, especially if you control the loader
and the headers used to compile the BPFs.

Cheers,
Benjamin
