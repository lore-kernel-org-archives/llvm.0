So to get a little bit of clarity here as to the architectural contract as=
 opposed to the current implementations:

1=2E WRNSRNS is indeed intended as an opt-in, as opposed to declaring rand=
om registers non-serializing a posteori by sheer necessity in technical vio=
lation of the ISA=2E

We should not blindly replace all WRMSRs with WRMSRNS=2E We should, howeve=
r, make wrmsrns() fall back to WRMSR on hardware which does not support it,=
 so we can unconditionally replace it at call sites=2E Many, probably most,=
 would be possible to replace, but for those that make no difference perfor=
mance-wise there is really no reason to worry about the testing=2E=20

It is also quite likely we will find cases where we need *one* serializati=
on after writing to a whole group of MSRs=2E In that case, we may want to a=
dd a sync_cpu_after_wrmsrns() [or something like that] which does a sync_cp=
u() if and only if WRMSRNS is supported=2E

I don't know if there will ever be any CPUs which support WRMSRNS but not =
SERIALIZE, so it might be entirely reasonable to have WRMSRNS depend on SER=
IALIZE and not bother with the IRET fallback variation=2E

2=2E WRMSRNS *may* perform a fully serializing write if the hardware imple=
mentation does not support a faster write method for a certain MSR=2E This =
is particularly likely for MSRs that have system-wide consequences, but it =
is also a legitimate option for the hardware implementation for MSRs that a=
re not expected to have any kind of performance impact (full serialization =
is a very easy way to ensure full consistency and so reduces implementation=
 and verification burden=2E)

3=2E All registers, including MSRs, in x86 are subject to scoreboarding, m=
eaning that so-called "psychic effects" (a direct effect being observable b=
efore the cause) or use of stale resources are never permitted=2E This does=
 *not* imply that events cannot be observed out of order, and cross-CPU vis=
ibility has its own rules, but that is not relevant for most registers=2E

4=2E WRMSRNS immediate can be reasonably expected to be significantly fast=
er than even WRMSRNS ecx (at least for MSRs deemed valuable to optimize), b=
ecause the MSR number is available to the hardware at the very beginning of=
 the instruction pipeline=2E To take proper advantage of that, it is desira=
ble to avoid calling wrmsrns() with a non-constant value in code paths wher=
e performance matters, even if it bloats the code somewhat=2E The main case=
 which I can think about that might actually matter is context-switching wi=
th perf enabled (also a good example for wanting to SERIALIZE or at least M=
FENCE or LFENCE after the batch write if they will have effects before retu=
rning to user space=2E) There is also of course the option of dynamically g=
enerating a code snippet if the list of MSRs is too dynamic=2E
