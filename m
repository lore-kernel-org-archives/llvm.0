Possibly; the other attach paths usually check and avoid calling into 
the driver to reattach the currently-attached domain, so at worst it 
could conceivably cause refcounting or data corruption issues inside a 
driver which tracks a current domain pointer internally and assumes it 
won't alias the new one. However I guess in practice either our current 
drivers don't mind, or any which do aren't seeing multi-device groups.

 From a quick history dive, it seems that the iommu_group_add_device() 
one was in fact the original default domain attach site, but things 
diverged in 6e1aa2049154 ("iommu: Move default domain allocation to 
iommu_probe_device()"), where IIRC we still had to deal with a mix of 
drivers calling iommu_group_add_device() and/or 
iommu_group_get_for_dev() plus the new probe_device path, so it may have 
still been needed (or at least seemed risky to remove) at that point, 
but then it was overlooked for cleanup after the whole probe_device 
conversion was finished?

Thanks,
Robin.
