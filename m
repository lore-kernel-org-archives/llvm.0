Looking more closely at the current code, it seems we just skip any 
attach at all in this case. Thus although there can be technically be a 
mismatch (physically, the device will be either partly or fully assigned 
to the current domain if it is grouped by ID aliasing, or in limbo if it 
is grouped for ACS reasons), it *should* be corrected whenever the 
current owner next detaches its domain. This shouldn't actually be a 
problem in the usual case, since the new device generally won't do 
anything if the existing ownership prevents its driver from binding.

I don't have a particularly strong opinion on changing this behaviour, 
but I guess what's nagging me is that we could do a better job of 
calling out that it *is* a behaviour change, and its implications. 
Namely that they are slightly better if the device binds to the same 
owner, in that it could rely use the current domain straight off without 
the risk of being in ACS limbo, but also slightly worse in that if the 
attach fails for any reason, it will now trash aliased RIDs of devices 
that *were* working OK. It also means that the device could bind to any 
*other* driver with driver_managed_dma and have a much better guarantee 
of having access to the other owner's domain, with all the pitfalls 
therein, but that's only a strengthening of a pre-existing problem :)

Thanks,
Robin.
