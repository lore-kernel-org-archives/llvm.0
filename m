FWIW my current workflow includes building the kernel under macOS, so
there=E2=80=99s some interest from me, but that will pass once the =
porting
project progresses enough. So far I get by with some local duct tape.

I really wanted to do it in a VM as a saner path, but I didn't find
a satisfactory way to share the working source tree between the macOS
host and Linux guest (which wouldn't slow down the build).
