I can confirm a regression with allyesconfig but not allmodconfig using
LLVM 16.0.6 on my 80-core Ampere Altra system.

allmodconfig: 8m 4s
allmodconfig + CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION=n: 7m 4s
allyesconfig: 1h 58m 30s
allyesconfig + CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION=n: 12m 41s

I am sure there is something that ld.lld can do better, given GNU ld
does not have any problems as earlier established, so that should
definitely be explored further. I see Nick already had a response about
writing up a report (I wrote most of this before that email so I am
still sending this one).

However, allyesconfig is pretty special and not really indicative of a
"real world" kernel build in my opinion (which will either be a fully
modular kernel to allow use on a wide range of hardware or a monolithic
kernel with just the drivers needed for a specific platform, which will
be much smaller than allyesconfig); it has given us problems with large
kernels before on other architectures.

CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION is already marked with 'depends on
EXPERT' and its help text mentions its perils, so it does not seem
unreasonable to me to add an additional dependency on !COMPILE_TEST so
that allmodconfig and allyesconfig cannot flip this on, something like
the following perhaps?

diff --git a/init/Kconfig b/init/Kconfig
index 32c24950c4ce..25434cbd2a6e 100644
--- a/init/Kconfig

If applying that dependency to all architectures is too much, the
selection in arch/riscv/Kconfig could be gated on the same condition.

Cheers,
Nathan
