How much do we really care about supporting device hotplug while using 
VFIO in a kdump kernel? Surely if anything ever deserved a "don't do 
that"...

In fact I struggle to imagine how it would even be possible for a device 
which *was* present and active when the previous kernel crashed, and 
thus needs deferred attach, to somehow evade bus_iommu_probe() in the 
kdump kernel until after the rest of its group has managed to get as far 
as binding a driver to claim ownership :/

And even if someone did manage to achieve all of this, is it really 
beneficial to let this device start spamming IOMMU faults and/or 
potentially corrupting whatever the kdump kernel *is* trying to do in 
said owned domain, on the offchance that the user might eventually bind 
it to VFIO (or whatever) as well and expect it to then work? TBH I'd say 
that banishing it to roam free in deferred-attach limbo, peacefully 
grazing the wastelands of dead-kernel memory and failing to support any 
non-DMA-API funny business, is the preferable option.

Thanks,
Robin.
