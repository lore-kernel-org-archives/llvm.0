+1 here. If you can't keep W^X, both approaches are equally doomed.

Yet, there is a relevant detail here. ENDBR has a pre-defined/fixed 
opcode, which means that it is predictable from the binary perspective. 
Because of that, compilers already do security optimizations and prevent 
for example the emission of ENDBR's opcode as immediate operands. This 
very same approach can be used by JIT stuff, preventing ENDBRs to be 
emitted as unintended gadgets. Because KCFI hashes aren't predictable, 
you can't (or at least I can't think of a way to) prevent these from 
being emitted as operands, which means that if you have an IBT-able 
machine, you will want to enable it even if you have KCFI.

With this said, the instrumentation for KCFI on IBT-enabled machines 
should be of at least 9 bytes (5 for the hash/mov and 4 for ENDBR, not 
counting the additional 4 bytes we asked for).

As per the above-analysis, if we can make FineIBT instrumentation fit in 
12 bytes, this means that the 9 bytes required for KCFI+IBT plus three 
bytes would suffice for having FineIBT (again, if we can make it fit). 
And this would make that call go away.

- Callee-side checks allow you to make an specific function 
coarse-grained without making an indirect call instruction 
coarse-grained. I.e: If you have a binary blob or some function that for 
whatever reason can't have a hash, you just disable the check in this 
function, making it reachable by every indirect call in the binary but 
being reasonably able to measure the risks behind it. If you make an 
indirect call coarse-grained, this means that now this indirect call can 
reach all functions in the binary, including functions like 
"disable_cet" and "disable_super_nice_security_feature". The risk 
impacts of these latter relaxations are much harder to measure, imho 
(yet, I would enjoy hearing counter-arguments, if any).

We have that for IBT in clang already (I implemented and upstreamed it 
back when you were trying ibt-seal in objtool). I did not find the time 
to test it with the final IBT support but it is in my todo list to take 
a look and perhaps send a RFC here. FWIIW,
