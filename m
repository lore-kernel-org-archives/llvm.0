Right, although this is for cc-option, not as-option, no?

All good points, I think that is a good fix as well.

Interesting... I suspect that is likely intentional, as some compiler
flags could be used during preprocessing (it's come up before:
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/55656) but I was not able to
figure out exactly where in clang the flags were consumed but Driver.cpp
is quite large and I didn't look too hard :)

More importantly, it still allows us to catch invalid assembler
arguments:

$ clang -c -x assembler-with-cpp /dev/null -o /dev/null -Wa,-foo
clang-16: error: unsupported argument '-foo' to option '-Wa,'

$ clang -c -x assembler-with-cpp /dev/null -o /dev/null -Wa,--noexecstack

Agreed. Thank you as always for your feedback!

Cheers,
