It's true that this is not a strict functional dependency, but there is
a substantial performance cliff here.

With CALL_OPS we only fall back to the ftrace_ops_list_func() when there
are multiple ops associated with a given callsite. Where we have a
single ops for a callsite, if the direct call is out of range, the
ftrace caller will call trace_ops::direct_call.

Without CALL_OPS, if there are unrelated ops registered (attached to
difrerent callsites), the ftrace_caller trampoline will call
ftrace_ops_list_func(), and we'll iterate over all of the registered ops
to find the relevant ops and trampoline, every time an out-of-range
direct call is used.

So the big questions are:

(1) How often is a direct call being made?
(2) Where does BPF allocate its direct call trampolines?

From a skim of arch/arm64/mm/init.c, EXECMEM_BPF covers
VMALLOC_START..VMALLOC_END, the vast majority of which is out-of-range
for a BL from the core kernel or a module. So if EXECMEM_BPF is used,
that's likely to be problematic.  Hopefully I'm missing something such
that BPF trampolines are almost always allocated in-range of a BL?

When we originally implemented CALL_OPS and DIRECT_CALLS for arm64, the
understanding was that we'd have many ops with direct calls. We believed
that the ftrace_ops_list_func() penalty was so substantial that it
wasn't worthwhile supporting direct calls in a configuration where
bouncing through that would be common.

If we need to support this configuration, then I strongly suspect we
need to make other changes too in order for it to be worthwhile.

Following from the comment regarding EXECMEM_BPF above, it looks like
both s390 and loongarch don't define EXECMEM_BPF, and only define
EXECMEM_DEFAULT with a subsstantially limited range, which I suspect
keeps their direct calls within range.

Can you comment on how you've tested in-range vs out-of-range
attachements here?

Have you made any performance measurements, or was this just functional
enablement?

Mark.
