To add a little bit to what Maxime said, about the "userspace loader".

One thing I initially worked on on HID-BPF was a kernel-side loader.
Because BPF allows you to run the syscalls from the kernel itself,
nothing prevents you to make an extra "loader" module with the bpf.o
embedded in it that would do the loading of the BPF from within the
kernel itself.

On HID-BPF, my userspace loader was too fancy at some point and the
kernel loader started to be too big. Especially because we depend on
"potentially" connected devices, and embedding all the BPFs in the
module started to be way too much.

But for panels and embedded systems, it would totally make sense to have
a Kconfig that cherry picks which BPF needs to be embedded in the
panel-bpf-loader module, and that module gets loaded/included in the
vmlinux directly, and at probe time, it just attaches the struct_ops.

Well, of course this surely can be integrated with some DT definition
somewhere, but I haven't pushed the thinking too much.

Anyway, no userspace/initramfs required in this case!

Cheers,
Benjamin
