Quick answer on this, because I had the very same questions regarding
HID-BPF:
- in BPF, you can require (and by default it does) that only GPL
	compatible BPF programs are loaded, closing the argument of "closed
	licence and distribution restriction"
- also, a BPF program can be disassembled much easier than a binary
	blob, and I remember Alexei showing me an example where you get almost
	the source code from the BPF object in just one pass.

Cheers,
Benjamin
