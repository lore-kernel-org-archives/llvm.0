I just expressed that you're trying to compare modules which are already
hard to handle since they can be loaded anytime with BPF. Adding an additional
complexity on top of modules won't simplify things at all.

Sorry I never meant to patronize you in any way, I just explained my position
on why DDIC are bridges. So perhaps I didn't understand your question.

I'm sorry if you felt like this, I expressed multiple times this patchset
is great and very well written, I only expressed some legitimate questions
about BPF because I'm ignorant on the subject and the impact it will have
on my volunteer DRM panel maintenance activity.

I'm sorry if this felt as fear, anxiety or abusive behaviour.

So this remark comes from directly from the cover letter arguments, which
are mainly helping to facilitate OEMs and distros to ship panels drivers
faster and would help "ship the programs separately from the
kernel, and with a different lifecycle".

Since I still don't understand how it will help OEM and distros, because I'm
no more an OEM for while and I don't run a distro and since I maintain the
subsystem I feel legitimate to understand exactly how it would solve
the *real* issue you expressed.

Let me be clear, I want people to upstream panel drivers, and since I took
over the panel maintainership I have a constant driver review and merge
rate, so perhaps it means I need to improve how I handle the susbsystem ?
Or is writing a panel driver too hard ? Am I to strict on the review ?
TBH I'll handle the BPF driver the same way, so again it makes me feel
this solution is not the right way to solve this, or I should just do
something else ?

I think we should stop arguing here, since my words were badly interpreted,
and we should leverage the Plumbers and OSS/ELC next week to discuss this
in-person.

Thanks,
Neil
