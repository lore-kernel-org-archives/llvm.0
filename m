We have a couple of months to get fixes into the next release so it's
not an emergency at this point.  If you want people to see things
promptly you really need to do things like send them with subject lines
that look like something that might be relevant for them to review
(generally, at least visually resemble how other commits in the area
look).  I don't know if I even opened this mail first time around
because based on the subject it looks like something for drivers/soc not
a subsystem I maintain.  Given that none of the SOF people responded
it's likely something similar applied there.

In any case, if you think something's been lost the content free pings
either here or on IRC aren't that helpful - they're not directly
actionable.  It is generally more helpful to resend, that way people
have the patch to hand and don't need to go looking for it.
