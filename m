Virtually all "generic" distributions are shipping the panel as modules
today anyway, because anything else is nothing but impractical. But
maybe you don't consider them serious enough. Also, applications live in
userspace already, so can be ran after this driver would be initialized
anyway.

Yes, if an error happens before the DRM driver loads, it won't be shown
on the screen. This is already the case for any panel driver today on
any major !embedded distribution. And with built-in drivers, this can
also happen before or while the DRM driver loads.

The solution is always the same though: load simpledrm first, move to
the proper DRM device once it's functional. It still works with this
solution.

I have no idea what a DDIC mean.

Let's not kid ourselves, it's *already* a blob. We just sugar-coated it
enough that we can be happy and call it GPL.

We can already make a proprietary, out-of-tree, panel driver today. That
being said, the only license we allow for BPF programs here is GPL, so
if anything it would be less of a concern for this than it would be for
regular panels.
