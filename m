Right, sorry about that :/ I initially thought the problem was much
simpler and the diff was more reasonable before I truly saw what was
happening and by that point, trying to break things apart felt like
navigating a mine field. I will definitely keep that in mind for the
future though.

Appreciate it! I don't have access to some of the hardware that is
special cased in this code so I definitely would not mind some
additional eyes and testing for this change.

Ah, that all makes sense, good to know that this solution will allow all
of that to continue to work.

If there are any issues or further comments, I am happy to follow up in
whatever way I need to. Thanks again for the review and tentative
acceptance!
