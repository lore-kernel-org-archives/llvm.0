i386_defconfig + CONFIG_LTO_CLANG_FULL=y + CONFIG_X86_GENERIC=y is
enough to reproduce this:

$ make -skj"$(nproc)" ARCH=i386 LLVM=1 mrproper defconfig

$ scripts/config -d LTO_NONE -e LTO_CLANG_FULL -e X86_GENERIC

$ make -skj"$(nproc)" ARCH=i386 LLVM=1 olddefconfig all
ld.lld: error: inline assembly requires more registers than available at line 538
ld.lld: error: inline assembly requires more registers than available at line 538

We have a known issue with 32-bit x86 '-march='/'-mtune=' and running
out of registers can be reproduced without LTO:

https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1589

Until there is a fix for that, I don't think that it is worth
investigating this further.

Cheers,
Nathan
