The BPF loader, so either in kernel loader or userspace loader through
uevents, depending on how the driver discussions are going.

generic-*hci all have a generic component *and* a platform specific part
for quirks, and yet none of them require a platform specific compatible
to be added to work. PCI has that too.

This driver has a generic part and a platform specific part for quirks.

How is that not a description of the binding we're discussing?

Cool. What can I do to add this binding to the list of "weird Maxime
shit" or is this kind of exception only for Qualcomm?

Or should we do it the other way and ship the binding anyway, and in two
years, when it will have been in device tree in the wild and
we-cannot-change-it-we-swear, we will be able to upstream it?

And in the process reward the ones *not* playing the upstream game.

Not really. The discussion was "but you're describing something that
isn't hardware". And none of the above are. And were acked. Some
recently.

Sigh... Look, I really don't care about an argument DT maintainers use
at their discretion for this. We both know full well that it's been and
still is inconsistenly applied, and you also know that it's not like
I've been playing the DT game since pretty much the beginning (on ARM
anyway). So it's not like I don't want to make it work, I do. But what I
care about is enabling that driver to work.

I reused exactly the same binding than the last major binding that was
merged for panels, and support about the same number of panels. I guess
that was a mistake, so sorry for that.

I'm fine with reworking the binding any way you want as long as it still
allows for the same use-case, but I would have hoped for a better
feedback on how to do so than "oh what a huge pile of shit this is".
