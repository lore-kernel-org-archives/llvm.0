I would be very concerned if you did see any impact, given this flag is

It was updated as part of the shift to '-std=gnu11':

https://git.kernel.org/linus/e8c07082a810fbb9db303a2b66b66b8d7e588b53

The UML tree is based on 5.17-rc6, which does not have that change.
There should not be a merge conflict though.
