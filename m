Thanks! We're doing this for the entire build and found quite some 
bugs in upstream userspace projects as well, like configure/m4 
hardcoding things like binutils ar instead of our toolchain 
configured llvm-ar.

Yes, the intention was to set GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR="" in the ebuild, 
but now we have a better approach suggested by you below :)

What we do right now is add an exception for the entire kernel, to 
allow it to make mixed toolchain calls (wrappers don't fail the 
build). AFAICT this is the last bug before we can start enforcing 
"pure" LLVM builds, at least on more recent kernels.

Older kernels have been known to work as well (eg 5.4) after 
fixing some bugs which were not strictly in the kernel codebase, 
like:

That seems like a better approach, thanks. It makes sense to allow 
distributions to specify locations of their userspace libraries 
since the kernel has no control over how various distros are 
configured.

According to the original commit message adding this change, in 
some cases Clang might be able to autodetect these paths, but 
autodetection does not work for all possible configurations.

If a reliable generic Clang autodetection mechanism is possible, 
then setting these vars/flags becomes a no-op and can be dropped, 
until then CLANG_CROSS_FLAGS solves our problem.

If Nick is also ok with the CLANG_CROSS_FLAGS approach, I'll send 
that to bpf-next. Thanks again!
