I think it would be better not to have the --std=3Dgnu11 change in the olde=
r
stable kernels by default, as this has introduced build warnings and other
smaller issues, as well as raising the minimum compiler version.

The users that are stuck on older kernels for some reason tend to
overlap with those on older compilers. One example here is Android,
which used to ship with a gcc-4.9 build as the only non-clang toolchain,
and was using this for building their kernels. If someone wants to
pull in stable updates into an older Android, this would fail with
-std=3Dgnu11. Others may be in the same situation.

Changing some of the 5.x stable branches to -std=3Dgnu11 is probably
less of a problem, but I would not know where to draw the line exactly.
Maybe check with the Android team to see what the newest kernel is
that they expect to be built with the old gcc-4.9.
