Is it April 1?

Have you estimated the performance cost of checking the result of
all integer arithmetic.

If you have a cpu with 'signed/unsigned add(etc) with trap on overflow'
instructions then maybe you could use them to panic the kernel.
But otherwise you'll need a conditional branch after pretty much
every arithmetic instruction.
As well as the code bloat there is likely to be a 50% chance they
are mis-predicted slowing things down a lot more.
IIRC at least some x86 cpu do not default to static prediction (eg
backwards taken forwards not) but always use data from the branch
prediction logic - so the first time a branch is seen it is predicted
randomly.
