I guess I'm not the one working on out-of-tree panel drivers then. But
yeah, I don't dispute that statement.

Again, you're putting words in my mouth. I never said I don't want
panels to embrace atomic. I said we shouldn't extend the panel API, I
told you twice what I meant exactly by that:

So, yeah, my point is we already have an atomic API to support panels:
it's the bridge one. If your plan is to make the panel API an equivalent
to the bridge API, then it just makes no sense when all consumers are
handling bridges anyway. Just write a bridge driver for your panel IC,
and you're done. It works today, and you don't have to extend anything.
And you can embrace your atomic panel.
