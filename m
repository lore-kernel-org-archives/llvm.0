Yes, but since you're going to emit a retpoline, and objtool already
generates a list of retpoline sites, we can abuse that. If the
instruction after the trap is a retpoline site, we a CFI fail.

It is. int3 is also smaller by one byte, but the exception is already
fairly complicated, but I can see if we can make it work.

Yeah, and it needs help, also see:

  https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211119165630.276205624@infradead.org/

Specifically, clang needs to:

 - CS prefix stuff the retpoline thunk call/jmp;
 - stop doing conditional indirect tail-calls.
