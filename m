"Si" is an invalid constraint. Unfortunately, GCC recognizes "S" as a
valid constraint and ignores trailing characters (asm_operand_ok). That
is, GCC would accept "Siiiii" as well...

The GCC support for "S" is great. The initial aarch64 port in 2012 supports "S".

Yes, "S"(&((char *)key)[branch])  would do the right thing.
I have compared assembly output. It's a matter of "s" vs "s + 0" and "s+1" vs "s + 1".

This topic, loosely related to this patch, is about switching to PIC
compiles. I am not familiar with the Linux kernel, so I'll mostly leave
the discussion to you and Ard :)

That said, I have done a lot of Clang work in visibility/symbol
preemptibility and linkers, so I am happy to add what I know.

-fvisibility=hidden only applies to definitions, not non-definition
declarations.

I've mentioned this at
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220429070318.iwj3j5lpfkw4t7g2@google.com/

     `#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)` is very similar to -fvisibility=hidden -fdirect-access-external-data with Clang.
     ...
     The kernel uses neither TLS nor -fno-plt, so -fvisibility=hidden
     -fdirect-access-external-data can replace `#pragma GCC visibility
     push(hidden)`.
