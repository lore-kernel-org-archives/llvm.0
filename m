Not quite.  Same rules as u16 + u16 - on architectures where int is wider
than 16 bits it's (int)u16 + (int)u16 and yields int, on 16bit ones it's
(unsigned int)u16 + (unsigned int)u16 and yields unsigned int.

You *can't* get smaller-than-int out of ? :, same as you can't get it
out of addition, etc.

__builtin_choose_expr() would do it, but I would take a cast over that
ugliness.

FWIW, it might make sense for clang to keep track of the following
property: expression has the same value as it would if integer promotions
in it had been replaced with integer promotion of result.

Example: with
	unsigned short x, y, mask;

expresion "x & y" is interpreted as and_int((int)x, (int)y), which is equal
to (int)and_u16(x, y), so that expression has the property in question.
"x != 12 ? x : y" has the same property.  "x + y", OTOH, doesn't - if x and y
are both 32768, x + y is add_int((int)x, (int)y), i.e. 65536, while
(int)add_u16(x, y) would be 0.

For a somewhat more subtle example,
	(x & ~mask) | (y & mask)
is interpreted as
	or_int(and_int((int)x, not_int((int)mask)), and_int((int)y, (int)mask))
which is equal to
	(int)or_u16(and_u16(x,not_u16(mask)), and_u16(y, mask))
IOW, the property in question holds for that one, despite having a subexpression
(~mask) that does *NOT* have that property.  (int)not_u16(0) is 0xffff and
not_int((int)0) is (assuming 32bit int) 0xffffffff.  Upper 16 bits get fouled;
applying & with known-16bit launders them off...

That predicate is behind the handling of small bitwise types in sparse;
otherwise all operations on __be16 would trigger warnings due to promotions
from __be16 to int.  And aforementioned subtle example is common enough, so we
had to deal with it.  See commit d24967cb847b "[PATCH] handle fouled-bitwise"
in sparse git...
