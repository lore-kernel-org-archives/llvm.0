For the whole set:

Reviewed-by: James Clark <james.clark@arm.com>

I checked that the new test passes on an AWS Graviton 3 instance and
with a build of mainline libunwind. I also checked that the PAC masks on
the samples look sensible.

The tests also still pass when run on N1SDP which doesn't have pointer
authentication.
