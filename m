I read a bit more of the series and understand it a bit better now.

No. You've defined some arbitrary list of supply names not just in the 
binding, but in the kernel. I think both are a mistake. Can't the BPF 
prog define the supply names and pass those to the kernel? Then when you 
have a panel with 'foo' and 'bar' supplies, you don't need a kernel 
change or some remapping to the existing set of names. The only real 
exception we have there is if it's a single supply, just use 
'power-supply'. It's the same issue with GPIOs, but there's generally 
less variability with them.

The whole point of requiring specific compatibles and not doing "generic 
bindings" is that's the only way the OS implementation can evolve 
without changing the DT. You can have a specific driver or a generic 
driver or a generic driver using BPF and which one can change over time 
if needed, but from a DT perspective we don't care.

So first, make this BPF stuff work with any existing panels (or some 
defined set). I'm not saying convert everything, only that you could. 
Otherwise you've failed the test of if the driver implementation 
changes, does the binding have to change.

After that, the remaining problem is only how do you make it 
work with unknown panels (only unknown to the kernel as any new panel 
still needs a binding). There's 2 ways we can solve that. Either make 
the kernel be able to bind to a generic driver without a compatible 
match or have a fallback compatible. The former could be done by 
userspace (though I saw gregkh added a taint for userspace bind 
recently) or we could somehow make the kernel bind to any DSI child 
devices without a match.
