Hmmm indeed that comes back to the existing constructs and is certainly
more in line with the rest of the code (plus it will not be affected by
-O0).

I seem to remember a register allocation issue which kept me away from
implementing it this way on i386 back then, but given that my focus was
not as much on i386 as it was on other platforms, it's likely that I have
not insisted too much and not tried this one which looks like the way to
go to me.
