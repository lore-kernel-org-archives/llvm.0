What reads the most specific compatible?

What? You can't add a generic compatible in these cases.

Self contained in a node that's specifically not h/w.

Extra hints that are safe to ignore.

Virtual h/w which tends to have special needs.

Shrug. Weird Qcom shit...

Just a container... Though I can't say I really like any of the audio 
bindings.

All really irrelevant to this discussion other than the panel binding...

There are things which aren't h/w, but this is h/w and we've already 
made decisions about how panels in particular are represented. We of 
course have some remanents of how we don't want to do things.

There's all of 3 panels supported. Compared to all the other panels we 
have, hardly the rule over the exception. You can always fine "bad" 
examples or exceptions.

That one defines a single supply. Any other MIPI SPI panel with 
different supplies or GPIO controls probably has its own binding. Trying 
to parameterize that in DT doesn't work. We've rejected trying to do 
that in DT over and over. What's your story here for that?

Really that's the least of my concerns.
