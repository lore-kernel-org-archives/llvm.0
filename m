Yes, the warning purposefully does not trigger when the constant is a 1
or 0 (as those are usually indicative of an intentional logical
operation):

https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/dfdfd306cfaf54fbc43e2d5eb36489dac3eb9976/clang/lib/Sema/SemaExpr.cpp#L13917-L13919

In this case, it is 100, so I kind of understand why this might be
ambiguous to the compiler.

I do not necessarily disagree, as you can see from the differential
review that I linked in the message, but I also understand it is a fine
line to tread when writing compiler warnings between wanting to catch
as many potential problems as possible and having too much noise for
developers to sift through. I think this is erring on the side of
caution.

diagtool tree tells me this warning is already on by default.

I think so too.

Thanks for the feedback! Either route is fine with me but if the v3d
patch is going to go in via drm-misc-next, it seems like it would not be
too much trouble to push this one with it.

Cheers,
Nathan
