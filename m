In this specific case, there is.  It's a stack allocation of an array
that depends on the number of 512-byte blocks per page.  With 4k pages,
that's only 8.  With 256k pages, that's 512.  With an 8-byte pointer,
that's a 4kB allocation, and even with a 4-byte pointer, that's a 2kB
stack allocation, which is still going to blow the prescribed stack
limit.

This is not unique to NTFS!  An NTFS-specific "fix" is inappropriate.
It's just that nobody's paying attention to the warnings coming from
fs/buffer.c:

include/linux/buffer_head.h:#define MAX_BUF_PER_PAGE (PAGE_SIZE / 512)

int block_read_full_folio(struct folio *folio, get_block_t *get_block)
{
...
        struct buffer_head *bh, *head, *arr[MAX_BUF_PER_PAGE];

I don't know why I'm not getting a nastygram about that one, but it's
all bufferhead based filesystems.

The reasoning there is faulty.  If you have a 64k (or 256k) page size,
your stack is correspondingly huge and can handle these kinds of
allocations.
